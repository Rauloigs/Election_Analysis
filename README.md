# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 

Along with Tom, the objective of this election audit analysis is to provide the Colorado Board of Elections with the results.
Before the Challenge the purpose was to go through the .csv file were all of the votation data is and expose the following:

1. Total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote. 

These 5 mentioned points were meant to be exposed at a file that we created named election_analysis.txt. The output was the following:

Now the board wants us to provide them with 3 outputs more: 

1. The voter turnout for each county.
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout.


## Election-Audit Results: 

The purpose of our code was to expose the results in the terminal and in a text file named *election_analysis.txt* so the following image is the output of our code in the terminal:

These same results than ran at the terminal are the same results projected in the text file, so lets take a look at the results in the .txt:

Now that you´ve seen the results in both "locations" lets go to specific details of the results:

- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
**369,711** Votes 
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

- Which county had the largest number of votes?
**Denver** was de county with the largest number of votes.

- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

**Total of Votes: 369,711**
*Charles Casper Stockham:* 85,213
*Diana DeGette:*           272,892
*Raymon Anthony Doane:*    11,606

- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

The winner was **Diana DeGette** with **272,892** votes and with a **73.8%** of the total votes.
