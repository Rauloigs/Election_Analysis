# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 

Along with Tom, the objective of this election audit analysis is to provide the Colorado Board of Elections with the results.
Before the Challenge the purpose was to go through the .csv file were all of the votation data is and expose the following:

1. Total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote. 

These 5 mentioned points were meant to be exposed at a file that we created named election_analysis.txt. The output was the following:

Now the board wants us to provide them with 3 outputs more: 

1. The voter turnout for each county.
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout.
